# Publish with Pagecast

Pagecast turns a local **HTML or Markdown** file (a report, plan, doc, or
dashboard) into a shareable public URL. Use this skill to offer that at the
right moment, then do it on a yes.

## When to offer

**Default to offering.** Whenever you produce an `.html`/`.htm` or
`.md`/`.markdown` file that a person could reasonably share, proactively offer to
publish it — once, right after you finish making it. Do **not** wait to be asked,
and do **not** stay silent because you are unsure whether it is "worth it." If it
could be shared, offer.

This includes:

- A report you generated — test/coverage/Lighthouse/Playwright output, a data
  dashboard, an analysis, a "here's what I built/found" summary.
- A written plan, proposal, design doc, spec, release notes, or doc.
- A static web project that was just built, with a generated entry file such as
  `dist/index.html`, `build/index.html`, `out/index.html`, or `public/index.html`.
- Any time the user says "share", "publish", "make a link for", or "send" a doc.
- A `PostToolUse` hint fired saying an HTML/Markdown file was created — treat that
  as a cue to offer.

**The only files to skip** (don't offer): scratch/draft notes the user is clearly
keeping private, source code, config files, secrets, and repo-meta files (README,
CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, TODO/tasks), or anything
under `node_modules`/`dist` build internals. When it is borderline, **offer** —
the user can just say no.

Ask **at most once per file.** If the user declines or ignores the offer, drop it
and don't re-ask for that file. Never nag across multiple turns.

## The one question to ask

> "Want me to publish this with Pagecast? It'll create a shareable public link."

Only on an explicit **yes** do you proceed. Publishing makes the file publicly
reachable — **never publish without confirmation.**

## How to publish

Run the headless CLI with the **absolute path** and `--json`:

```sh
npx pagecast publish "/absolute/path/to/file.md" --json
```

(HTML and Markdown both work — Markdown is rendered to a clean page. If `pagecast`
is installed globally/in the project, `pagecast publish "<path>" --json` is the same.)

**Publishing a plan** (e.g. after plan mode): the plan lives in your context, not
a file yet. If the user wants it shared, first write the plan markdown to a file
(e.g. `./plan.md`), then publish that path. Don't overwrite an existing file the
user cares about — pick a clear new name.

For static web projects that should get a new shareable `/p/<token>/` link,
build first and publish the generated entry file:

```sh
npm run build
npx pagecast publish "/absolute/path/to/dist/index.html" --json
```

If the user asks to deploy or update an entire static site/project, deploy the
built folder directly to a named Cloudflare Pages project:

```sh
npx pagecast publish site "/absolute/path/to/dist" --project "project-name" --branch main --json
```

`--branch` is optional and defaults to `main`, so this also works:

```sh
npx pagecast pages deploy "/absolute/path/to/dist" --project "project-name" --json
```

Use this instead of raw Wrangler commands like `npx wrangler pages deploy`.
Direct site deploys replace the target Pages project contents, so do not guess
the `--project`; use the user's named project or ask for it.

Parse the JSON on stdout:

- **Success** → `{ "ok": true, "url": "https://<project>.pages.dev/p/<token>/", ... }`
  - Give the user the `url`. Offer to drop it into a PR/Slack message, and
    mention they can rename the URL, re-sync, or revoke it from `npx pagecast`.
- **Not signed in** → `{ "ok": false, "statusCode": 401, ... }`
  - This is the one-time setup. Tell the user to run
    **`npx pagecast pages setup`** once, or run **`npx pagecast`** and click
    **Connect Cloudflare**, then offer to retry. After that, publishing is
    headless — a plain "yes" is enough every time.
- **Multiple accounts** → `{ "ok": false, "statusCode": 409, ... }`
  - Tell the user to run `npx pagecast pages setup --account <account-id>` once,
    or run `npx pagecast` to pick which Cloudflare account to publish from, then
    retry.
- **Any other error** → relay `error` concisely and offer to retry.

## Cloudflare Pages commands

Use these lower-level commands when the user explicitly asks about Cloudflare
setup, status, project listing, or direct Pages deployment:

```sh
npx pagecast pages setup --project "project-name" --json
npx pagecast pages status --json
npx pagecast pages projects list --json
npx pagecast pages deploy "/absolute/path/to/dist" --project "project-name" --branch main --json
```

If the user does not specify a branch, omit `--branch`; Pagecast deploys to
`main`.

## Notes

- Always pass an **absolute** path (resolve relative paths against the cwd first).
- The first publish auto-creates the user's Pages project — no manual setup beyond
  the one-time Connect Cloudflare login.
- Use `npx pagecast publish site` or `npx pagecast pages deploy` for direct
  static-folder deploys to a named Pages project.
- Use `npx pagecast` for source-folder build settings, URL renaming, re-sync,
  and revoke controls.
- To update a page **in place at the same URL**, the user can re-sync from the
  Pagecast app; re-running `publish` creates a new link. Old links keep working
  until revoked.
