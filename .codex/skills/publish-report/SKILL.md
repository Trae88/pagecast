description: Publish local HTML, Markdown, or built static web projects with Pagecast as shareable public URLs. Use whenever Codex creates or finishes an .html, .htm, .md, .markdown, or static build output that a person could share (a report, plan, doc, dashboard, or analysis) — proactively offer to publish it without being asked — and whenever the user asks to publish, share, make a public link for, or send a local report/doc/dashboard/web project from terminal, Codex CLI, or Codex desktop.

# Publish with Pagecast

Pagecast turns a local **HTML or Markdown** file (a report, plan, doc, or
dashboard) into a shareable public URL backed by the user's Cloudflare Pages
project. Use this skill to offer that at the right moment, then do it on a yes.

## When to offer

**Default to offering.** Whenever you produce an `.html`/`.htm` or
`.md`/`.markdown` file that a person could reasonably share, proactively offer to
publish it — once, right after you finish making it. Do **not** wait to be asked,
and do **not** stay silent because you are unsure whether it is "worth it." If it
could be shared, offer.

This includes:

- A report you generated — test/coverage/Lighthouse/Playwright output, a data
  dashboard, an analysis, a "here's what I built/found" summary.
- A written plan, proposal, design doc, spec, release notes, or doc.
- A static web project that was just built, with a generated entry file such as
  `dist/index.html`, `build/index.html`, `out/index.html`, or `public/index.html`.
- Any time the user says "share", "publish", "make a link for", or "send" a doc.

**The only files to skip** (don't offer): scratch/draft notes the user is clearly
keeping private, source code, config files, secrets, and repo-meta files (README,
CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, TODO/tasks), or anything
under `node_modules`/`dist` build internals. When it is borderline, **offer** —
the user can just say no.

Ask **at most once per file.** If the user declines or ignores the offer, drop it
and don't re-ask for that file. Never nag across multiple turns.

## The one question to ask

> "Want me to publish this with Pagecast? It'll create a shareable public link."

Only on an explicit **yes** do you proceed. Publishing makes the file publicly
reachable — **never publish without confirmation.**

## How to publish

Run the headless CLI with the **absolute path** and `--json`:

```sh
npx pagecast publish "/absolute/path/to/file.md" --json
```

(HTML and Markdown both work — Markdown is rendered to a clean page. If `pagecast`
is installed globally/in the project, `pagecast publish "<path>" --json` is the same.)

Published links use **memorable word-slugs** (e.g. `/p/hollow-paperclip/`) and are
long and hard to guess (private) by default. The user can rename a link — or make a
short, shareable "drop" link — from the `npx pagecast` app.

### Publish options

Add any of these to a `publish` command:

- `--expires <7d|12h|never>` — edge-enforced link expiry (default 30d). The page
  returns 410 once expired; `--expires never` keeps it live until revoked. The
  result JSON reports `expiresAt` (or none when never).
- `--password "<pw>"` — gate the page behind a password, enforced at the edge so
  every file of a multi-file report is covered. `--no-password` removes protection.
  The result JSON reports `passwordProtected: true`.
- `--label "<name>"` — set the page's display name in the Pagecast app.

```sh
npx pagecast publish "/absolute/path/to/report.html" --expires 7d --password "hunter2" --json
```

**Publishing a plan** (e.g. after plan mode): the plan lives in your context, not
a file yet. If the user wants it shared, first write the plan markdown to a file
(e.g. `./plan.md`), then publish that path. Don't overwrite an existing file the
user cares about — pick a clear new name.

## Live goal / progress page

When you're working toward a **`/goal`** (a long autonomous run the user can't
easily watch), the user often can't see what's happening. Proactively **offer
once**:

> "Want me to publish a live progress page for this goal? You'll get a public
> link you can open anytime to see status and what's done."

On an explicit **yes**:

1. Write a `pagecast-goal.md` in the working dir with the goal, status, a
   done/next checklist, and a one-line "latest", e.g.:
   ```markdown
   # <short goal title>

   **Goal:** <the goal condition, in your own words>
   **Status:** In progress · updated <time>
   **Progress:** 3 / 8 steps

   ## Done
   - [x] <step>

   ## Next
   - [ ] <step>

   ## Latest
   <one line: what you just did / any blocker>
   ```
2. Run `npx pagecast goal publish "<abs path>/pagecast-goal.md" --json` and give
   the user the returned `url`.
3. **After each meaningful step**, rewrite `pagecast-goal.md` and re-run the
   **same** `npx pagecast goal publish … --json` — it updates the **same URL** in
   place (do NOT use plain `publish`, which mints a new link each time).
4. When the goal is met, do a final update; optionally `npx pagecast goal stop`.

There is one goal page per workspace. If a command reports `recreated: true`, the
old link was gone and the URL changed — tell the user the new URL.

## Static web projects

For a static web project that should get a new shareable `/p/<slug>/` link, build
first and publish the generated entry file:

```sh
npm run build
npx pagecast publish "/absolute/path/to/dist/index.html" --json
```

If the user asks to deploy or update an entire static site/project, deploy the
built folder directly to a named Cloudflare Pages project:

```sh
npx pagecast publish site "/absolute/path/to/dist" --project "project-name" --branch main --json
```

`--branch` is optional and defaults to `main`, so this also works:

```sh
npx pagecast pages deploy "/absolute/path/to/dist" --project "project-name" --json
```

Use this instead of raw Wrangler commands like `npx wrangler pages deploy`.
Direct site deploys replace the target Pages project contents, so do not guess
the `--project`; use the user's named project or ask for it.

## Reading the result

Parse the JSON on stdout:

- **Success** → `{ "ok": true, "url": "https://<project>.pages.dev/p/<slug>/", ... }`
  - Give the user the `url`. Mention they can rename the URL, re-sync, or revoke it
    from `npx pagecast`.
- **Not signed in** → `{ "ok": false, "statusCode": 401, ... }`
  - This is the one-time setup. Tell the user to run **`npx pagecast pages setup`**
    once, or run **`npx pagecast`** and click **Connect Cloudflare**, then offer to
    retry. After that, publishing is headless — a plain "yes" is enough every time.
- **Multiple accounts** → `{ "ok": false, "statusCode": 409, ... }`
  - Tell the user to run `npx pagecast pages setup --account <account-id>` once, or
    run `npx pagecast` to pick which Cloudflare account to publish from, then retry.
- **Any other error** → relay `error` concisely and offer to retry. Do not claim
  success.

## Cloudflare Pages commands

Use these lower-level commands when the user explicitly asks about Cloudflare
setup, status, project listing, or direct Pages deployment:

```sh
npx pagecast pages setup --project "project-name" --json
npx pagecast pages status --json
npx pagecast pages projects list --json
npx pagecast pages deploy "/absolute/path/to/dist" --project "project-name" --branch main --json
```

If the user does not specify a branch, omit `--branch`; Pagecast deploys to
`main`.

## Codex usage notes

- Always pass an **absolute** path (resolve relative paths against the cwd first).
- Run terminal commands in the user's current project directory so the `.pagecast/`
  config and publish history stay with that project.
- The first publish auto-creates the user's Pages project — no manual setup beyond
  the one-time Connect Cloudflare login.
- If the user asks only for a command, provide the command (and any one-time setup
  note) instead of running it. If they ask Codex to publish, run it after
  confirmation and report the resulting URL or the exact failure.
- To update a page **in place at the same URL**, the user can re-sync from the
  Pagecast app; re-running `publish` mints a new link. Old links keep working until
  revoked.
